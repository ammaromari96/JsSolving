<!-- Write a function named calculateSupply that:
takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age 100).
outputs the result to the screen like so:
"You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"

Ex: calculateSupply(30, 3);
=> 'You will need 76650 cups of tea to last you until the ripe old age of 100;
